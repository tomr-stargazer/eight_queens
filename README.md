I decided to do this after seeing this tweet thread:

and becoming curious if I could come up with a software solution.

It took 1 hour, 25 minutes for me to write code that correctly produces the following solution:
```python
array([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
       [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]])       
       ```
(it only takes a couple of seconds to run the code itself!)
